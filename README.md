# Mc-HertzLib
My own utility to quickly and easy create Minecraft plugins.

## What?
Mc-HertzLib (named after my [Unity library](https://github.com/Hertzole/HertzLib)) is a library I use when developing Minecraft to make it less painful and reuse code, and most importantly, make all the plugins consistent.

## Development notice
This library is being developed together with plugins for a private server. This means I may never truly finish this, nor keep it updated. It's just here for reference. But it also means it's never really done. It's in active development.

## License
Do whatever. I don't care. I just ask for your morality to not straight up rip the code and sell it as a premium plugin.. but hey, I'm not gonna stop you.
